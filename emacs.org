* Emacs
** Editing text
   1. simple editing
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (split-window-below)
  (switch-to-buffer-other-window (get-buffer-create "*simple-editing*"))
#+end_src

   2. keyboard macros

   3. isearch, C-M-%
** Editing program text
   1. modes for everything
   2. evaluation!
** What's a “program”, anyway?
   - typesetting files?
#+begin_src latex :file "/tmp/latex-logo.pdf"
  \LaTeX
#+end_src

   - finances
#+begin_src ledger :cmdline -M reg Expenses :exports both

** Programmable editor
   - crosshairs
   - ace-jump-mode
   - multiple-cursors
     + 1
     + 2
     + 3
   - <other crazy editing techniques>
** Programmable editor, II
   - games!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (tetris)
  (snake)
  (2048-game)
#+end_src
** Programmable editor, III
   users implement new features:

   - style checkers
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (execute-kbd-macro (kbd "M-x writegood-mode RET"))
#+end_src

   - version-control front-ends
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (magit-status ".")
#+end_src
   ... and whole new applications:
   - twitter clients
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (switch-to-buffer (get-buffer ":home"))
#+end_src
   - note takers and personal organizers

* And there’s more
** Documented
   Emacs has documentation:

   - Tutorial (execute-kbd-macro (kbd "C-h t")) (help-with-tutorial)
   - Manual (execute-kbd-macro (kbd "C-h i d m emacs RET"))
   - Keystrokes (C-h c, C-h k, C-h w)
   - Functions, variables (C-h f, C-h v)
** Customizable
   Emacs is customizable

   - (Almost) all functionality implemented in emacs Lisp
   - (Almost) all functionality directly available at any time
     * initialization file: [[file:~/.emacs.d/init.el]]
     * minibuffer: M-: =eval-expression=
     * almost anywhere: C-x C-e =eval-last-sexp=
     * =*scratch*= buffer: lisp interaction
     * ielm: lisp Read-Eval-Print loop (ielm)
   - (Much) functionality is hookable
   - Lisp functions can be advised
   - Programmers’ manual (execute-kbd-macro (kbd "C-h i d m elisp RET"))
* Endmatter
** Conclusions
   - extremely customizable
   - not rocket science
   - clearly the best editor in the world

   Emacs:
   - “a nice operating system; it could do with a better text editor”
   - ... but actually its text editor is pretty nice ...
   - ... and even if you don’t like it, you can change it all until
     you do.
